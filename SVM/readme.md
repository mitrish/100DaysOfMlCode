**DAY - 0**: *SVM implementation with inbuilt Sklean libraries.*
            *First, is the vanilla implementation using sklearn. Next, to show the classification patterns by plotting as a                  graph, I have chosen only 2 features, to bring it in a 2-Dimensional Space*
            *The accuracy is **1** when all the features are used and **0.842** when two features are used*
